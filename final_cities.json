Contributing editor Matt Hranek says he never goes hungry in this city\u2014bistecca alla fiorentina at Trattoria Le Mossacce and a panino al lampredotto (stewed tripe sandwich) at the San Lorenzo Market are always on the menu. He usually avoids the Pitti Palace (along with much of the mediocre leather goods that proliferate throughout the city), but never misses the David reproduction in the Palazzo Vecchio.

This dichotomy is illustrated at the famous farang (foreigner) backpacker street Khao San Road\u2014long the enclave of tourists toting massive packs, it has now evolved into a bustling mixture of commerce, tourism, and nightlife and has some of the best people-watching anywhere in the world."

As editor David Jefferys says, \u201cit\u2019s simply a city that won\u2019t die.\u201d This immortality is buttressed by a thriving dining and shopping scene\u2014try Tawlet, the \u2018farmers\u2019 kitchen\u2019 of Souk el Tayeb (every day, a different regional Lebanese chef is showcased) and Artisan du Liban et d\u2019Orient for traditional local garments and crafts. Adding to Beirut\u2019s appeal as a top world city is the presence of numerous fabulous hotels: Four Seasons Hotel Beirut, Le Gray, and Hotel Albergo come to mind.\u200b"

There's an exploding food scene, with vegetables, wine, and cheese coming from the gorgeous Cape Winelands; and then there's the top of Table Mountain which, on the right day, can feel as pristine and empty as when the Dutch first pitched up in the early 17th century. Eat at Luke Dale-Roberts' The Test Kitchen; go to sunbathe and people-gawk at Clifton 2nd Beach; surf, if you dare, atMuizenberg (sharks!), and climb Lion's Head for crazy 360-degree views of the city"

Its laid-back, outdoorsy vibe is exemplified nowhere better than the iconic Bondi Beach. Visit the Icebergs swimming club next to the beach (established in 1929) and its eponymous dining room for a bite and a spectacular view. For a real Oz original, grab a flat white coffee at Single Origin Roasters in Surry Hills."

To see where the city is going, visit the Outer Sunset\u2014it's foggy all the time and far removed from the city center, but it's close to Golden Gate Park and near Ocean Beach, a huge, dramatic stretch of sand within city limits and packed with surfers.

In Kyoto, which served as Japan\u2019s capital for a millennia and is still its capital of art and design, you find both. The city is home to the country\u2019s greatest (and greatest number of) national treasures, from pieces of individual artwork to 10th-century temples, and also to some of its most exquisite food, tea, and crafts. But even better than the seafood laid out like jewels at its Nishiki Market, or the smell of incense at Sanjusangendo temple, or the thrill of watching young geishas clop by on their geta sandals, is the sense of politesse and refinement one finds here, from every vendor, at every shop or shrine: it\u2019s a dream of Japan that still exists, waiting for you to discover it."

Legendary cafes like the New York Kávéház and the Gerbeaud are must-visits, as are the spas built in the 16th and 17th century by Ottoman occupiers Rudas and Király. These places (where you can still bathe) are full of wonderful touches like roaring granite lion heads spewing out warm mineral water. \u201cIf you can muscle out the Hungarian grandma from her prized spot (because you know it\u2019s the prized spot), then you\u2019ve found nirvana, \u201d says contributing editor Matt Hranek."
